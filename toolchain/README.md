# Contract Toolchain
This module, developed in Python with the help of the PyTezos library, allows you to automate and speed up the processes of compiling, publishing and interacting with contracts on the Tezos blockchain.
The system also allows you to monitor costs and export them to CSV or JSON files.

## Pre-Requisities
To start it, you need to use a personal address on the blockchain.
Create a *secretKey* file inside the *toolchain* folder (the one we are in) and enter the private key inside it.
For the testing phase, I recommend using a Temple wallet.

## Start
To start, simply enter the command ```python3 main.py```
